<h1>Tornado Related Fatalities in the United States</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project is an exploratory analysis of where tornadoes are the deadliest in the United States. In my initial research I was surprised to learn that the states with the most tornadoes are not necessarily the states with the highest fatality rates. The states that have the most tornadoes fall geographically into what is commonly known as Tornado Alley, or the Great Plains region, but the states with the most tornado related fatalities are geographically in the Southern Untied States. 
As a lifelong Southerner who has seen tornado destruction up close, I wanted to know what factors contribute to how deadly the tornadoes are in my region. In this project I analyze those possible contributors. 

<h2>Description</h2>
To begin this analysis, I calculated the percentage of tornadoes that each state had over the years 1950-2022 to determine which states had the most. I then chose to focus on states that had one tornado for every 30 miles or less. This gave me 16 states to further investigate:

Oklahoma, Mississippi, Kansas, Florida, Iowa, Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, Indiana, Nebraska, Arkansas, South Carolina, Missouri, Texas, Maryland, and Tennessee. 

Primary data was obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that contained information on every recorded tornado in the United States from 1950-2022. 
Other data was obtained from Census.gov and webscraped from Wikipedia.
